# SimplePress : All in One Wordpress

After repeating installation of Wordpress with the same plugin, 
I've made this flavored-install that covers most of my needs.

## Installation

Commands for standard installation:

``
git clone git://github.com/alx/SimplePress.git simplepress

cd simplepress

cp wp-config-sample.php wp-config.php

nano wp-config.php
``

* Please refer to Wordpress manual to install normally the system
* Activate the plugin you need from the Plugin Administation Panel
